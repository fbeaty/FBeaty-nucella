#Script to analyze snail response variables from the mesocosm experiment
#Datasheets include the following measurements:
#July 1st (initial): length, thickness, total weight
#August 2nd (mid): submerged weight, total weight
#Sept 2nd (final): length, thickness, total weight, submerged weight

#Note: Because submerged weight was only collected in the middle of the experiment, changes to tissue & shell weight are only reflective of
#the growth between mid & final stages (reference this in figure captions?)
